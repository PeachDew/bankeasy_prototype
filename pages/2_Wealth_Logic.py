# Investing Basics in the Philippines
## Why Invest Instead of Just Saving?
- Protect your money from inflation  
  Prices of goods in the Philippines rise 3â€“5% yearly. Regular savings accounts typically earn less than 1%.  
- Grow wealth over time  
  Investing lets you earn from interest, dividends, or asset growth.  
- Reach your life goals  
  A comfortable retirement, your childâ€™s education, or a future home.

## Core Principles to Live By
1. Start early â†’ Compounding works better with more time.  
2. Set a clear goal â†’ Short-term (1â€“3 years), medium-term (3â€“7 years), long-term (7+ years).  
3. Diversify â†’ Mix safer assets (bonds, deposits) and growth assets (stocks, equity funds).  
4. Know your risk appetite â†’ Conservative, moderate, or aggressive.
